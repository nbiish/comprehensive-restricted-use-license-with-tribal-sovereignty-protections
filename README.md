## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing Your License (`@LICENSE` file)

Follow this process to adapt the `@LICENSE` template for *your* project:

1.  **Use Your AI Assistant for Placeholders (Recommended First Step):**
    *   Provide your AI with the `@LICENSE` content and your known details using a prompt like this:
        ```
        "I need to customize the provided '@LICENSE' template file. Please replace all placeholders like <|placeholder_name|> using this information:
        - My Name: [Your Name]
        - My Indigenous Name (Optional): [Your Indigenous Name]
        - My Tribal Nation: [Your Tribal Nation Name]
        - My GitHub Username: [Your GitHub Username]
        - My Project/Repository Title: [Your Repo Title]
        - Current Year: [Current Year]
        - My State: [Your State Name]

        For any remaining placeholders (like <|specific_treaty_...|>, <|tribal_court_name|>, <|interest_rate_percentage|> in Section 7, etc.), please list them clearly and ask me for the specific information needed. Explain what each requires if I'm unsure."
        ```
    *   *Follow Up:* Answer the AI's questions to fill in the remaining details.

2.  **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Legal & Cultural Review (Mandatory):**
    *   **Consult Experts:** Take the partially filled license to your **Tribal Legal Department** (or qualified Indian law attorney) AND your **Cultural Authorities/Elders**.
    *   **Legal Verification:** Your legal team MUST review:
        *   Treaty references (`<|specific_treaty_...|>`) and overall sovereignty assertions (Section 3) for accuracy and applicability to *your* Nation.
        *   Jurisdictional clauses (`<|tribal_court_name|>`, alternative forums in Section 8, governing law in Section 9).
        *   Enforcement mechanisms and remedies (Sections 7, 10), including the specific financial figures (`<|interest_rate...|>`, `<|statutory_damages...|>`, etc.). Ensure alignment with *your* tribal code and court capabilities.
        *   Waivers and immunity statements (Sections 7.6, 12).
    *   **Cultural Verification:** Your cultural authorities MUST review:
        *   TK Labels (Section 2) to ensure they accurately reflect *your* community's protocols.
        *   Prohibited/Permissible Uses (Sections 4, 5) for alignment with cultural values and protocols.
        *   References to traditional practices or values (e.g., Sections 7.2c, 7.5c, 10e).
    *   **Coordinate:** Ensure legal and cultural reviews are integrated.

3.  **Final Checks:**
    *   Confirm all `<|placeholders|>` have been correctly filled or removed.
    *   Double-check the GitHub URL in the citation (Section 1).
    *   Rename the file from `@LICENSE` to `LICENSE`.

### ‚öñÔ∏è LLM Prompt Templates for Expert Legal Review

Experts reviewing this *template* or a user's *adaptation* can use these prompts with AI assistance:

1.  **General Analysis**:
    ```
    "Analyze this tribal software license ([link to file or paste text]) from the perspective of [Target Tribe]'s sovereignty and legal framework. Identify conflicts with tribal code, treaties ([list specific treaties]), constitution, or governance. Suggest specific wording changes for better alignment and enforceability under [Target Tribe]'s law."
    ```
2.  **Jurisdiction Focus**:
    ```
    "Evaluate the tribal court selection (Section 8) and governing law (Section 9) clauses for compatibility with [Target Tribe]'s judicial system and inter-tribal relations jurisprudence. Suggest modifications for clarity, enforceability within [Target Tribe]'s courts, and addressing comity/full faith & credit issues, referencing [Target Tribe]'s relevant codes or case law."
    ```
3.  **TK Label & Protocols Verification**:
    ```
    "Review TK labels (Section 2) and use restrictions/permissions (Sections 4, 5) against [Target Nation]'s specific cultural protocols for knowledge/data protection, sharing, consent, and digital representation. Suggest additions, removals, or modifications to align with these protocols."
    ```
4.  **Treaty Specifics**:
    ```
    "Adapt Section 3 to explicitly reference [Target Tribe]'s key treaties (e.g., [Treaty Name Year]) and reserved rights doctrine as recognized under their specific legal history. Draft revised text for Section 3 strengthening the sovereignty assertion based on these specific treaties."
    ```
5.  **Enforcement & Remedies Strategy**:
    ```
    "Assess the remedies (Section 10), compensation (Section 7), and enforcement framework. Propose modifications tailored to [Target Tribe]'s legal environment, court capabilities, available remedies (including traditional ones referenced in tribal code), and judgment enforcement procedures. Evaluate the 'Sovereign Revocation Right' (Section 3) under [Target Tribe]'s law."
    ```
